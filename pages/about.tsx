        I am a graduate of the University of Kansas, where I was a History Major
        and more recently a graduate of the Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp where we
        built full-stack apps with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. During my
        free-time I love being outdoors or dabbling with photography - scuba
        diving, hiking, going to the beach, or going skiing are some of my
        favorite adventurous activities. And I also love reading science fiction
        and keeping up with various publications about the newest technology
        trends and other programming languages. You can find me on{' '}
