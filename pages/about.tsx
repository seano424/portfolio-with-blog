      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm Sean, a passionate front-end developer specializing in React and
        JavaScript. My mission is to translate user-focused designs into smooth
        website that run blazingly fast.

      <p>
        I’m currently working as a front-end developer at TrendyMinds where I
        help develop websites that combine powerful functionality with intuitive
        design to give clients the best user experience. We mainly work with
        Craft CMS, the LAMP stack, React (Next JS), and Tailwind CSS.

        I am a graduate of the University of Kansas, where I was a History Major
        and more recently a graduate of the Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp where we
        built full-stack apps with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. During my
        free-time I love being outdoors or dabbling with photography - scuba
        diving, hiking, going to the beach, or going skiing are some of my
        favorite adventurous activities. And I also love reading science fiction
        and keeping up with various publications about the newest technology
        trends and other programming languages. You can find me on{' '}
